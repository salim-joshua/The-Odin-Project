# Tasks

## Known Bugs
    - its possible to input multiple commas
    - Chaining operators to the current value after "equals" was hit, the chained operator will calculate with the current value buffer, as it isnt cleared (on purpose, to enabel "equals" chaining)
        -> some reworks of the operator logic will be needed

## Features to implement
    - keyboard input
    - expression evaluation (for keyboard input)
    - Calculation history
